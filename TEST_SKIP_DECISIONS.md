This inventory records why skipped tests are not part of the retained CLI/Core
validation baseline. It is intentionally feature-specific; skipped tests must
not be re-enabled with live credentials or unavailable external infrastructure.

## Candidate deterministic coverage

The following skipped tests are retained behavior candidates and should be
handled by the owning package before the feature is considered fully covered:

_(none remaining — all candidates in this list have been resolved or moved
to the deferred table above; see `serve.test.ts` in the deferred table)_

These are not silently treated as passing. They remain a tracked follow-up
inventory with an explicit owner boundary and are excluded from the required
retained-closure baseline until re-enabled or removed with evidence.

### Resolved

- `core/util/withExponentialBackoff.test.ts` — re-enabled
  (`describe.skip` → `describe`). The retry/backoff behavior is fully
  deterministic (no network, no external infra, fake timers only) and
  remains important supported behavior. Root cause of the original skip: two
  assertions expected a stale literal error string
  (`"Failed to make API call after max tries"`) that no longer matches the
  implementation's actual message
  (`` `Failed to make API call after ${maxTries} retries` ``). Fixed the two
  assertions to match current, correct behavior; no production code changed.
  Validation: `npx cross-env IGNORE_API_KEY_TESTS=true NODE_OPTIONS=--experimental-vm-modules jest util/withExponentialBackoff.test.ts`
  — 6/6 passed. Full-suite regression check:
  `npm run test` in `core/` — 51/59 suites passed (865/973 tests passed, 108
  skipped in the remaining un-migrated families), zero failures, zero new
  skips introduced. `npm run tsc:check` passed with no errors.

- `core/llm/countTokens.test.ts` — re-enabled all 7 remaining
  `describe.skip` blocks (`countTokens`, `pruneLinesFromTop`,
  `pruneLinesFromBottom`, `pruneRawPromptFromTop`, `pruneStringFromTop`,
  `pruneStringFromBottom`, `compileChatMessages`; `countTokensAsync` and
  `extractToolSequence` were already enabled). All behavior is fully
  deterministic (in-process tokenizer calls, no network, no external
  infra). Three distinct stale-test root causes were found and fixed, with
  no production code changes to `core/llm/countTokens.ts`:

  - `pruneRawPromptFromTop`/`pruneStringFromTop`/`pruneStringFromBottom`:
    the fixture string `"Hello world!"` tokenizes to 3 tokens under
    `gpt-4`/js-tiktoken, but the tests used `maxTokens` values (5) that
    never actually forced truncation, so the assertions
    (`result.length < original.length`) were unreachable. Adjusted the
    `maxTokens`/`contextLength`/`tokensForCompletion` fixture values so
    each call genuinely exceeds the token budget and truncation is
    exercised.
  - `compileChatMessages` "empty message list": the current
    implementation's `extractToolSequence` throws
    `"no user/tool message found"` when given zero messages — this is
    intentional (there is nothing to anchor the compiled result on), not
    a bug. Re-characterized the test to assert the throw instead of a
    graceful empty-array return.
  - `compileChatMessages` "maxTokens close to contextLength" and "filter
    empty/system messages": the function's signature changed from
    positional arguments returning a bare array to an options object
    returning `{ compiledChatMessages, didPrune, contextPercentage }`
    (see `core/llm/index.ts` for the real call site). Updated call sites
    to the object API and `.compiledChatMessages` access. Additionally,
    the system message is intentionally always preserved in the compiled
    output (extracted only for separate token accounting, then re-added),
    so the "filter" test's expected count was corrected from 1 to 2 and
    renamed to state that intent explicitly.
    Validation: `npx cross-env IGNORE_API_KEY_TESTS=true NODE_OPTIONS=--experimental-vm-modules jest llm/countTokens.test.ts`
    — 34/34 passed. Full-suite regression check: `npm run test` in `core/` —
    51/59 suites passed (886/973 tests passed, 87 skipped in the remaining
    un-migrated families), zero failures. `npm run tsc:check` passed with no
    errors.

- `core/util/ranges.test.ts` — re-enabled `describe.skip("getRangeInString")`
  (9 tests) and `test.skip("returns correct intersection for single line
overlap")` in the `intersection` block. All behavior is a pure, in-process
  string/range computation (no network, no external infra). Investigation
  found a mix of stale test fixtures **and two genuine, narrowly-scoped
  production bugs** in `core/util/ranges.ts`:

  - Stale fixtures (test-only fix): three `getRangeInString` tests used an
    `end.character` value that undercounted the target line's real length
    (each fixture line is 6 characters, e.g. `"Line 4"`, but fixtures used
    `3` or `5`), so the substring assertions were checking a truncated
    prefix instead of the full line the test's own `expected` string
    described. Corrected the `end.character` values to `6`.
  - Stale expectation (test-only fix): two "same start/end character"
    tests asserted a single-character result (`"L"`, `"n"`) for a
    zero-width range, which is inconsistent with `substring`'s semantics
    (a zero-width range must yield `""`, as already correctly exercised by
    the passing "same line, different characters" test). Corrected both
    expectations to `""` and renamed the tests to describe zero-width
    range behavior.
  - **Production bug 1** (`getRangeInString`, `core/util/ranges.ts`): the
    function had no guard for a reversed/invalid range
    (`start` after `end`). For a cross-line reversed range it returned a
    nonsense partial-line result instead of `""`; for a same-line reversed
    range it silently returned a wrong substring because JS's
    `String.prototype.substring` auto-swaps out-of-order arguments. Added
    an explicit `isReversed` guard at the top of the function returning
    `""` for any range where `start` is after `end`. The function's only
    production caller (`core/autocomplete/templating/constructPrefixSuffix.ts`)
    always constructs forward ranges, so this is purely additive
    hardening with no behavior change for any existing valid caller.
  - **Production bug 2** (`intersection`, `core/util/ranges.ts`): when two
    ranges' earliest end line coincided (`startLine === endLine` in the
    same-line branch), the function unconditionally took
    `Math.min(a.end.character, b.end.character)` — but if one range's real
    `end.line` is actually _later_ than that shared line (i.e. it doesn't
    end on this line at all), its `end.character` refers to a different
    line and must not bound the intersection here. This produced incorrect
    `null` results for ranges that genuinely overlap on a single line
    while one of them continues onto a later line. Fixed by only applying
    a range's `end.character` as a bound when that range's `end.line`
    equals the computed `endLine`. This function has a real production
    caller (`extensions/vscode/src/autocomplete/lsp.ts`, used to
    deduplicate overlapping definition ranges), so this fix corrects an
    actual duplicate-detection defect, not just a hypothetical case.
    Validation: `npx cross-env IGNORE_API_KEY_TESTS=true NODE_OPTIONS=--experimental-vm-modules jest util/ranges.test.ts`
    — 32/32 passed. Full-suite regression check: `npm run test` in `core/` —
    51/59 suites passed (897/973 tests passed, 76 skipped in the remaining
    un-migrated families), zero failures. `npm run tsc:check` in `core/`
    passed with no errors. `npm run tsc:check` in `extensions/vscode/` (the
    only other package importing `core/util/ranges.ts` production code)
    passed with no errors, confirming the `intersection`/`getRangeInString`
    signature is unchanged and the fix is safe for that caller.

- `core/util/index.test.ts` — re-enabled the 2 remaining skipped
  `dedent` edge-case tests (`it.skip` for CRLF line endings and tabs).
  `dedent`'s behavior is fully deterministic (pure string transformation,
  no network, no external infra). Both were stale test-expectation
  issues, not production defects — no changes were made to
  `core/util/index.ts`'s `dedent` implementation:

  - CRLF test: the implementation only strips the common _leading_
    indentation shared by all lines; it never trims trailing whitespace
    from an individual content line. The test's fixture ends its last
    content line with a literal `\r`, and the implementation correctly
    leaves that `\r` attached to the line (`"Hello\r\n  World\r"`), since
    trimming trailing per-line whitespace is out of scope for this
    function and no other passing test in this file expects it. Verified
    the actual output directly (temporary probe test, removed after use)
    before concluding the expected value (which omitted the trailing
    `\r`) was simply wrong. Corrected the expectation to match verified,
    correct current behavior.
  - Tabs test: verified by direct calculation that all three fixture
    lines (`"      \tHello"`, `"      \t\tWorld"`, `"      \t\t\t!"`)
    share an identical first 7 characters (6 spaces + 1 tab — line 1's
    only tab, line 2's first tab, and line 3's first tab all fall at the
    same position), making 7 the true common-indentation-prefix length,
    not merely a byte-count coincidence. The implementation's
    length-based `minIndent` calculation therefore strips exactly the
    correct common prefix, including the shared tab, and correctly
    preserves each line's non-common extra tabs
    (`"Hello\n\tWorld\n\t\t!"`). The original test expected the tabs to
    be left completely untouched (`"\tHello\n\t\tWorld\n\t\t\t!"`), which
    does not match correct common-prefix dedent semantics. Corrected the
    expectation to match verified, correct current behavior.
  - No production callers of `dedent` (`core/llm/templates/edit/gpt.ts`,
    `core/llm/templates/edit/codestral.ts`, `core/edit/lazy/replace.ts`,
    `core/edit/lazy/prompts.ts`, `core/autocomplete/filtering/test/testCases.ts`)
    use tabs or CRLF content — all are plain space-indented prompt
    templates — so there was no evidenced production defect to justify
    changing the shared `dedent` implementation (unlike the round 3
    `ranges.ts` fixes, which had concrete real-caller evidence).
    Validation: `npx cross-env IGNORE_API_KEY_TESTS=true NODE_OPTIONS=--experimental-vm-modules jest util/index.test.ts`
    — 64/64 passed. Full-suite regression check: `npm run test` in `core/`
    — 51/59 suites passed (899/973 tests passed, 74 skipped in the
    remaining un-migrated families), zero failures. `npm run tsc:check`
    passed with no errors.

- `core/util/generateRepoMap.test.ts` — re-enabled the sole
  `describe.skip("generateRepoMap")` block (3 tests). Behavior is fully
  deterministic (in-process file generation against a real temp test
  directory, no network, no external infra). All 3 failures were caused
  by pre-existing bugs **in the test fixture itself**, not in
  `core/util/generateRepoMap.ts` — no production code was modified:
  - The mock `groupedByUri` keys were built with `path.join(TEST_DIR,
...)`, but `TEST_DIR` is itself a `file://` URI (see
    `core/test/testDir.ts`), and Node's `path.join` collapses the
    URI's double slash (`file:///...` → `file:/...`). This produced
    mock keys that never matched the real `file:///...`-format URIs
    `generateRepoMap` collects via `walkDirs`, so its
    `pathsInDirsWithSnippets` bookkeeping never recognized a uri as
    already processed, and every file incorrectly reappeared in the
    "remaining uris without snippets" section. Fixed by building the
    mock keys with `joinPathsToUri` (`core/util/uri.ts`) — the same
    URI-safe join helper `generateRepoMap`'s own callers use — instead
    of `path.join`.
  - The "file read errors" test mocked `fs.promises.readFile`, but
    `generateRepoMap` actually calls `this.ide.readFile(uri)`, and the
    concrete `FileSystemIde.readFile` (`core/util/filesystem.ts`) uses
    the callback-style `fs.readFile`, not `fs.promises.readFile` — so
    the mock never intercepted anything and the simulated read failure
    never occurred. Fixed by mocking `testIde.readFile` directly (the
    actual method invoked), falling back to the real implementation for
    files other than the intentionally-failing one.
  - The same test's expected error-log string used a stale `Path:`
    label; the current implementation logs `Uri:`
    (`core/util/generateRepoMap.ts`'s catch block). Corrected the
    expected string to `Uri:` once the mock was fixed to actually fire.
  - Two tests' expected output included a trailing `\n` after the last
    plain-uri entry, but both code paths that write plain uri lists
    (the `includeSignatures: false` branch, and the "remaining uris
    without snippets" pass) build their content via
    `uris.map(...).join("\n")`, which never appends a trailing
    terminator — unlike the `includeSignatures: true` per-file blocks,
    which each end in `"\n\n"`. Verified this against all 4 current
    production callers of `generateRepoMap`
    (`core/tools/implementations/viewRepoMap.ts`,
    `core/tools/implementations/viewSubdirectory.ts`,
    `core/context/providers/RepoMapContextProvider.ts`,
    `core/context/retrieval/repoMapRequest.ts`) — each embeds the
    returned string as prose context in a prompt, where a missing
    trailing newline has no functional effect — so this is a cosmetic,
    not correctness, difference, and the fix belongs in the test
    expectation rather than in production output. Corrected both
    expectations to drop the stale trailing newline.
    Validation: `npx cross-env IGNORE_API_KEY_TESTS=true NODE_OPTIONS=--experimental-vm-modules jest util/generateRepoMap.test.ts`
    — 3/3 passed. Full-suite regression check: `npm run test` in `core/` —
    52/59 suites passed (902/973 tests passed, 71 skipped in the remaining
    un-migrated families), zero failures. `npm run tsc:check` passed with
    no errors.
- `core/diff/util.vitest.ts` — re-enabled the sole
  `describe.skip("matchLine")` block (10 tests; `streamLines` and
  `generateLines` in the same file were already enabled and passing).
  Behavior is fully consistent with the current, correct implementation
  in `core/diff/util.ts` — no production code was modified:
  - Removing the skip produced exactly 1 failure (of 10):
    "should match lines with tolerable differences" expected
    `matchIndex: 2` for `newLine = "console.log(a);"` against
    `oldLines = ["const a = 5;", "console.log(b);", "console.log( a );"]`.
  - `matchLine` is a first-match-wins linear scan (confirmed by reading
    its sole real caller, `core/diff/streamDiff.ts`, which relies on
    scanning old lines in order and taking the first sufficiently-close
    match to build a line-by-line diff). Verified via
    `fastest-levenshtein`'s `distance()` directly (`node -e`) that index 1
    (`"console.log(b);"`, edit distance 1, ratio 0.067) is closer than
    index 2 (`"console.log( a );"`, edit distance 2, ratio 0.118) and
    both are within the matching threshold, so the implementation
    correctly returns the first (index 1) match it encounters while
    iterating in order. The test's expectation of index 2 was a stale/
    incorrect fixture expectation, not a description of real behavior —
    corrected it to `matchIndex: 1` (still a genuine "tolerable
    difference" match, just at the index the algorithm actually reaches
    first).
  - Affected files: `core/diff/util.vitest.ts` only (one expectation
    corrected, `describe.skip` → `describe`). No production code changed.
  - Validation: `npx vitest run diff/util.vitest.ts` — 14/14 passed.
    Full `core/` vitest suite (`npm run vitest`): 94/98 files passed
    (1669/1700 tests passed, 6 skipped); the 3 failing files
    (`config/loadContextProviders.vitest.ts`, `util/repoUrl.vitest.ts`,
    `config/yaml/LocalPlatformClient.vitest.ts`) and the docker-dependent
    `OpenAI-compatible.vitest.ts` uncaught-exception cases were confirmed
    via `git stash` to fail identically on the pre-change baseline —
    pre-existing, unrelated to this change. `npm run test` (jest):
    52/59 suites, 902/973 tests, zero failures (unchanged — jest does not
    run `.vitest.ts` files). `npm run tsc:check` in `core/` passed with
    no errors.
- `core/config/ConfigHandler.vitest.ts` — re-enabled the sole
  `describe.skip("Test the ConfigHandler and E2E config loading")` block
  (4 tests). `core/config/ConfigHandler.ts` was **not modified** — this
  was test-only, but required a deeper architectural finding than prior
  rounds:

  - Removing the skip: 2/4 passed immediately ("should show only local
    profile", "should load the default config successfully"). The other
    2 failed with `expected undefined to be 'SYSTEM'` /
    `'SYSTEM2'`.
  - Root cause 1 (assertion shape): both failing tests read
    `config.systemMessage` off the value returned by
    `testConfigHandler.reloadConfig(...)`, but `reloadConfig` returns
    `{ config, errors, configLoadInterrupted }` — the actual
    `OCircuitConfig` is at `.config`, and tracing `config/load.ts`
    (`intermediateToFinalConfig`) showed that a raw `systemMessage`
    string (from either config.ts's `modifyConfig` or a merged
    `.ocircuitrc.json`) is converted into a rule pushed onto
    `finalConfig.rules` as `{ rule: "SYSTEM", source: "json-systemMessage" }`
    — there is no top-level `systemMessage` field on the resolved config
    at all. Corrected both assertions to check
    `result.config?.rules.some(r => r.rule === "..." && r.source === "json-systemMessage")`.
  - Root cause 2 (URI-mangling, same class of bug as round 5's
    `generateRepoMap.test.ts`): the `.ocircuitrc.json` test wrote via
    `fs.writeFileSync(path.join(TEST_DIR, ".ocircuitrc.json"), ...)`, but
    `TEST_DIR` is a `file://` URI and `path.join` collapses `file:///` to
    `file:/`, verified directly via `node -e` — the file was never
    written to the real workspace directory the `IDE` reads from. Fixed
    by using the existing `addToTestDir`/`setUpTestDir`/`tearDownTestDir`
    helpers from `test/testDir.ts` (the established pattern already used
    by `config/loadLocalAssistants.vitest.ts` for the same workspace-file
    scenario), added in `beforeEach`/`afterEach`.
  - Root cause 3 (architectural drift, found by direct tracing, not
    assumption): the "local" test profile normally loads config via
    `config.yaml` (`getConfigYamlPath()` auto-creates a default
    `config.yaml` the first time it's called if no `config.json` already
    exists), and `config/profile/doLoadConfig.ts` only calls
    `loadOCircuitConfigFromJson` (the function that applies config.ts's
    `modifyConfig` and merges `.ocircuitrc.json`) when **no**
    `config.yaml` is present. Confirmed via a temporary debug test that,
    unmodified, `result.config?.rules` was always `[]` for both tests —
    the legacy config.json+config.ts systemMessage path was silently
    unreachable for the profile under test. This is real, still-shipped
    production behavior (it's how a user who hasn't migrated to
    `config.yaml` experiences config.ts/`.ocircuitrc.json`), not a
    removed feature — so this was resolved rather than deferred: each of
    the 2 affected tests now deletes `config.yaml` and writes a minimal
    `config.json` (`{"models": []}`) before calling `reloadConfig`,
    deterministically forcing the same routing condition
    `doLoadConfig` uses in real usage. `afterEach` restores `config.ts`
    to its default content, removes the test-created `config.json`, and
    calls `getConfigYamlPath()` again to recreate `config.yaml`, so later
    tests in this file (and other files sharing the same
    `OCIRCUIT_GLOBAL_DIR`) see the normal YAML-based default profile
    again.
  - Affected files: `core/config/ConfigHandler.vitest.ts` only (skip
    removed, `beforeEach`/`afterEach` added, 2 assertions corrected, 2
    tests' setup rewritten to force the legacy JSON-config routing
    condition). No production code changed.
  - Validation: `npx vitest run config/ConfigHandler.vitest.ts` — 4/4
    passed, repeated 3 times back-to-back with identical results (no
    flakiness/ordering sensitivity). Full `core/` vitest suite
    (`npm run vitest`) — same 3 pre-existing failing files as round 6
    (`config/loadContextProviders.vitest.ts`, `util/repoUrl.vitest.ts`,
    `config/yaml/LocalPlatformClient.vitest.ts`), no new failures.
    `npm run tsc:check` in `core/` passed with no errors. An incidental
    test-run side effect on
    `core/test/.ocircuit-test/sessions/sessions.json` was reverted before
    finalizing, keeping the change atomic.

- `core/edit/lazy/deterministic.test.ts` — partially resolved. Un-skipped all
  5 remaining `test.skip` cases in the `deterministicApplyLazyEdit(` describe
  block (10 of 15 tests in this file were already enabled/passing). 1 of the
  5 was a genuine stale fixture and is now fully re-enabled and passing; the
  other 4 are re-characterized as intentionally deferred production
  limitations (re-skipped with a `TODO(RELIABILITY-003 round 8, deferred)`
  comment on each explaining the specific root cause, so they remain visibly
  tracked rather than silently reverted).

  - **Re-enabled (test-only fix):** `no lazy blocks in single top level
class` — root-caused via direct instrumentation of
    `deterministicApplyLazyEdit`/`programNodeIsSimilar` (temporary, reverted
    debug logging; no lasting change) to confirm the computed diff and
    reconstructed file content were byte-for-byte correct. The failure was
    the fixture's expected-diff text itself: `displayDiff()`'s
    `` `${symbol} ${line}` `` format always inserts one separator space
    between the `-`/`+` symbol and the original line's own leading
    indentation (confirmed against an already-passing fixture,
    `calculator-comments.js.diff`, which follows this convention
    consistently). The `no-lazy-single-class.js.diff` fixture's two changed
    lines had one fewer leading space than that convention requires. Fixed
    by adding the missing space to both lines in the fixture; no production
    code or test-file assertion logic changed.
  - **Deferred:** `calculator docstrings` — `programNodeIsSimilar`'s
    line-alignment check compares old/new lines at a fixed relative offset
    from the first matched line, which cannot handle inserted lines (e.g.
    JSDoc blocks) between otherwise-matching content. Confirmed via debug
    instrumentation that the root node was the only match candidate
    considered and its "matching lines" count fell well below the 50%
    threshold purely due to the interleaved docstring lines shifting every
    subsequent line's position. Fixing this needs a real alignment-algorithm
    change (e.g. LCS-based instead of fixed-offset), which is a production
    behavior change to a shared heuristic, not a narrow test fix.
  - **Deferred:** `calculator stateless` — confirmed via debug
    instrumentation that `deterministicApplyLazyEdit` computes the exact
    correct diff (byte-for-byte matches the fixture's expected diff), but
    `shouldRejectDiff`'s global `REMOVAL_PERCENTAGE_THRESHOLD` (0.3) rejects
    it as "too messy" because 22/46 (48%) of the diff lines are removals —
    an intentional, legitimate large rewrite (stateful → stateless
    calculator), not an artifact. Loosening or re-deriving this threshold
    (e.g. to account for paired removal+addition "replacement" lines vs. pure
    deletions) would change accepted/rejected outcomes for every caller of
    this deterministic-apply path in production, so it is deferred rather
    than tuned narrowly here.
  - **Deferred:** `gui add toggle` — same `shouldRejectDiff` removal-
    percentage limitation as `calculator stateless` (217/567 = 38% removals
    on a larger real-world fixture), confirmed via the same instrumentation
    approach.
  - **Deferred:** `should handle case where surrounding class is neglected,
with lazy block surrounding` — confirmed via debug instrumentation that
    `findLazyBlockReplacements` only compares nodes as siblings at matching
    tree depth. When the lazy-edit snippet omits the surrounding
    `class { ... }` wrapper (the scenario this test is named for), the
    top-level type comparison (`class_declaration` vs. bare statements)
    never matches, so the algorithm never descends into the class to find
    the `divide` method it should replace; it instead falls back to treating
    the whole old class as unmatched "replacement" content and appends the
    new snippet verbatim after it. Correctly handling a missing structural
    wrapper needs recursive-descent realignment logic, a real algorithm
    change with wider blast radius, not a narrow fix. (The sibling test
    "...without lazy block surrounding" was already passing before this
    round and is unaffected.)
  - Affected files: `core/edit/lazy/deterministic.test.ts` (1 test
    re-enabled, 4 re-skipped with explanatory `TODO` comments — net: 1 more
    test passing than before this round) and
    `core/edit/lazy/test-examples/no-lazy-single-class.js.diff` (fixture
    whitespace fix). No production code (`core/edit/lazy/deterministic.ts`)
    changed; all debug instrumentation added during investigation was fully
    reverted before committing.
  - Validation: `npx cross-env IGNORE_API_KEY_TESTS=true NODE_OPTIONS=--experimental-vm-modules jest edit/lazy/deterministic.test.ts`
    — 11/15 passed, 4 intentionally skipped (up from 10/15 passed, 5
    skipped). Full-suite regression check: `npm run test` in `core/` —
    52/59 suites passed (903/973 tests passed, up from the round-7 baseline
    of 902/973 — the +1 matches the single newly re-enabled test), zero
    failures. `npm run vitest` — same 3 pre-existing failing files as prior
    rounds, no new failures (this test file is Jest-only, not part of the
    Vitest run). `npm run tsc:check` passed with no errors. The 4 deferred
    cases are documented here (rather than left in the generic "Candidate
    deterministic coverage" list above) since resolving them needs
    production-code changes to shared matching/rejection heuristics with
    real regression risk, not simple ownership/fixture follow-up. An
    incidental `core/test/.ocircuit-test/sessions/sessions.json` test-run
    diff was reverted before finalizing, keeping the change atomic.

- `core/indexing/CodebaseIndexer.test.ts` — re-enabled both remaining
  `test.skip` cases ("should only re-index the changed files when
  changing branches", "shouldn't re-index anything when changing back to
  original branch"). Root cause: `core/util/filesystem.ts`'s
  `FileSystemIde.getBranch()` was a hardcoded stub that always returned
  `""` regardless of the real git branch. Confirmed via grep that
  `FileSystemIde` has zero production/runtime IDE consumers (not exported
  from `core/index.ts`'s public entrypoint; only ever instantiated by
  `core/test/fixtures.ts`, `core/context/providers/_context-providers.vitest.ts`,
  `core/indexing/docs/crawlers/DocsCrawler.test.ts`, and
  `binary/test/binary.test.ts`), so implementing real branch detection is
  a narrowly-scoped test-infrastructure fix, not a production behavior
  change. Implemented `getBranch()` using
  `execSync("git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD", { cwd })`, matching the
  same convention already used by the real, shipped
  `extensions/vscode/src/util/ideUtils.ts` implementation (falls back to
  `"NONE"` on error, e.g. an unborn/no-commit repo).

  - With real branch detection wired up, the first test passed
    immediately (per-branch tag reuse via the content-addressed global
    cache worked exactly as designed: the changed `test.ts` needed
    `compute`, the unchanged `main.py` only needed `addTag`).
  - The second test failed at first because neither this test nor the
    prior one ever called `refreshIndex()` to persist the computed plan
    for their respective branches — unlike every other test in this same
    sequential block, which calls `refreshIndex()` immediately after
    `expectPlan()`. Without that persistence step, the `"main"` branch's
    tag bucket was still empty when re-checked, so both files
    legitimately needed `addTag` (not zero pending work). Added the
    missing `refreshIndex()` calls (in "should create git repo for
    testing" and "should only re-index the changed files when changing
    branches"), matching the established pattern; the return-to-`"main"`
    plan then correctly resolves to zero pending work.
  - Affected files: `core/util/filesystem.ts` (`getBranch()` real
    implementation — test-infrastructure-only code, no production
    consumers) and `core/indexing/CodebaseIndexer.test.ts` (2 skips
    removed, 2 `refreshIndex()` persistence calls added).
  - Validation: `npx cross-env IGNORE_API_KEY_TESTS=true NODE_OPTIONS=--experimental-vm-modules jest indexing/CodebaseIndexer.test.ts`
    — 32/32 passed (up from 30/32), repeated 3x back-to-back with
    identical results (no flakiness). Full core jest suite
    (`npm run test`) — 52/59 suites passed, 905/973 tests passed (up from
    903/973 — the +2 matches the two newly re-enabled tests), zero
    failures. Full core vitest suite (`npm run vitest`) — same 3
    pre-existing failing files as prior rounds, no new failures (this
    test file is Jest-only, not part of the Vitest run). Confirmed no
    regression in the other `FileSystemIde` consumers:
    `_context-providers.vitest.ts` 8/8 passed;
    `DocsCrawler.test.ts` was already fully skipped (11/11 skipped),
    unaffected either way. `npm run tsc:check` passed with no errors. An
    incidental `core/test/.ocircuit-test/sessions/sessions.json` test-run
    diff was reverted before finalizing, keeping the change atomic.

- `extensions/cli/*` family (RELIABILITY-003 round 10) — 5 of 6
  candidate files fully or mostly resolved; 1 file's single stub test
  deferred (moved to the deferred table above).

  - `extensions/cli/src/util/fileWatcher.test.ts` — re-enabled both
    `it.skip` cases ("should detect when new files are created",
    "should detect when files are deleted"). Root cause: both tests
    wrote/deleted the watched file immediately after calling
    `startWatching()`, before the 50ms `isInitializing` suppression
    window (plus `fs.watch` setup time) elapsed — every other test in
    the same file already waits ~600ms after `startWatching()` before
    triggering a change, for exactly this reason. Applied the same wait
    pattern. Validation: file 8/8 passing, repeated 3x consistent; full
    cli vitest suite 1696/1723 passing (baseline for this round), zero
    failures; `npm run typecheck` clean.
  - `extensions/cli/src/tools/preprocess.test.ts` — re-enabled the
    `describe.skip` wrapper; 2 of 3 previously-skipped scenarios fixed,
    1 deferred. `listFilesTool.preprocess` now validates (via real
    `fs.existsSync`/`fs.statSync`) that the resolved `dirpath` exists
    and is a directory before returning a preview, and returns the
    resolved absolute path in `args.dirpath` rather than the raw input —
    updated the "directory arg present" test to mock
    `fs.existsSync`/`fs.statSync` and assert against the resolved path.
    `writeFileTool`'s diff-preview test was missing a
    `mockCreateTwoFilesPatch.mockReturnValue(...)` setup — added it.
    Deferred (re-skipped with `TODO`): "should show current directory
    when no directory arg" — `listFilesTool`'s `dirpath` is now a
    required schema field and `preprocess` unconditionally calls
    `path.normalize(args.dirpath)`, so omitting `dirpath` throws a
    `TypeError`; this is an intentional current API contract (schema
    requires the argument), not a bug, so re-enabling this exact
    scenario would mean adding an undocumented fallback contradicting
    the tool's own schema. Validation: file 14/15 passing (1 documented
    defer); full cli vitest suite 1710/1723 passing, zero failures;
    `npm run typecheck` clean.
  - `extensions/cli/src/util/prompt.test.ts` — re-enabled "should handle
    SIGINT (Ctrl+C) by exiting process". Root cause: `question()`'s
    returned promise never rejects on SIGINT (the SIGINT handler calls
    `process.exit(0)` as a side effect; in real usage that genuinely
    terminates the process, so the promise's fate is irrelevant) — the
    stale test asserted the promise itself rejects, which cannot happen
    under test (`process.exit` is necessarily mocked to avoid killing
    the test runner), so the promise hung forever and the test timed
    out. Rewrote the test to assert the actual, observable contract:
    the SIGINT handler is registered via `rl.on("SIGINT", ...)`, and
    invoking it closes the readline interface and calls
    `process.exit(0)`. No production code changed. Validation: file
    11/11 passing, repeated 3x consistent; full cli vitest suite
    1711/1723 passing, zero failures; `npm run typecheck` clean.
  - `extensions/cli/src/e2e/headless-simple.test.ts` — re-enabled all 3
    `it.skip` cases ("should output response and exit with -p flag",
    "should handle streaming responses in headless mode", "should work
    with minimal config"), previously skipped with the comment
    "requires mocking the LLM which doesn't work in subprocess". The
    codebase already has a working, deterministic solution for exactly
    this scenario (`test-helpers/mock-llm-server.ts`, already used by
    `headless-dynamic-responses.test.ts`): a local HTTP server started
    in the test process, referenced via an `apiBase` field in the
    generated config, so the CLI subprocess talks to a real local
    socket instead of a real provider — no external infrastructure
    required. Applied that established pattern to all 3 tests.
    Validation: file 8/8 passing (via `npm run test:e2e`), repeated 3x
    consistent; full e2e suite 64/65 passing (1 pre-existing, unrelated
    environmental failure in `headless-anthropic-api-key.test.ts` — a
    real network call to `api.anthropic.com` fails on TLS cert
    verification in this sandbox; confirmed present on unmodified HEAD
    via `git stash`, unaffected by this change); `npm run typecheck`
    clean.
  - `extensions/cli/src/stream/streamChatResponse.test.ts` — re-enabled
    both `describe.skip` blocks (`preprocessStreamedToolCalls`,
    `executeStreamedToolCalls`), all 6 tests now passing. Root causes
    (the file predates a services-DI refactor):
    `getAllAvailableTools()` (called internally by
    `preprocessStreamedToolCalls`) reads the `MODEL` service from the
    real `serviceContainer`, which was never initialized in these
    tests, causing "No factory registered for service ..." errors
    regardless of the tests' own mocks; `checkToolPermission` is
    imported by `streamChatResponse.helpers.ts` directly from
    `../permissions/permissionChecker.js`, not via the
    `../permissions/index.js` facade the tests were spying on, so that
    spy never intercepted the real call, and the real (also
    uninitialized) service-backed permissions state was used instead;
    `executeToolCall` is now invoked with a second
    `{ parallelToolCallCount }` argument the assertions didn't account
    for; and the "permission denied" test asserted a cascading
    "Cancelled due to previous tool rejection" message for a second
    denied call, but the current implementation evaluates every call's
    permission independently (no such cascade exists), so both calls
    are now denied on their own merits. Fix: bootstrap real services via
    `initializeServices()` (matching the established pattern in
    `streamChatResponse.modeSwitch.test.ts`), set real
    `TOOL_PERMISSIONS` service state via `serviceContainer.set(...)`
    instead of mocking the wrong module export, and update the two
    stale assertions to match current, evidenced production behavior.
    No production code changed. Validation: file 14/14 passing, repeated
    3x consistent; full cli vitest suite 1717/1723 passing, zero
    failures; `npm run typecheck` clean.
  - `extensions/cli/src/commands/serve.test.ts` — the single skipped
    test ("should have /exit endpoint that returns success response")
    was a placeholder stub (`expect(true).toBe(true)`) with its own
    comment admitting "this test is complex and requires proper module
    mocking setup". Investigated: the `/exit` route is defined inline
    inside `serve()`'s closure with no extractable factory, and
    `serve()` itself requires initializing ~6 service modules (config,
    model, tool permissions, agent file, chat history, storage sync)
    before reaching `app.listen` — confirmed by the adjacent, already
    passing "--org flag" test in the same file, which only partially
    mocks 2 of those services and wraps its `serve()` call in a
    try/catch expressly because full initialization isn't mocked.
    Reaching a live, request-testable `/exit` endpoint would require a
    genuinely broad test-infrastructure buildout, not a deterministic
    fixture fix — deferred (moved to the deferred table above) rather
    than force-fixed or silently left uninvestigated.
  - Commits: `14cc9dbcf` (fileWatcher), `66ea2d788` (preprocess),
    `f0d9b477b` (prompt SIGINT), `6cf45999d` (headless-simple),
    `220badb62` (streamChatResponse) — all pushed to `origin/main`, all
    independently passed the Ubuntu1 pre-push gate (242s, 265s, 238s,
    261s, 240s canonical build times respectively).

- `packages/config-yaml/src/__tests__/index.test.ts` (RELIABILITY-003
  round 11) — re-enabled the single `it.skip` stub, "should prioritize
  org over user / package secrets" (previously an empty placeholder
  with no body). Traced `getLocationsToLook()`'s resolution order
  (ModelsAddOn/Package for the block, Package for the assistant,
  Organization, then User) and `resolveFQSN()`'s consumption of that
  order to confirm the actual, current contract: an Organization-level
  secret is returned ahead of a User-level secret when both stores hold
  a value for the same secret name, and only `SecretType.User` results
  carry a raw `value` back to the client (Organization results
  intentionally omit it). Wrote a scoped test using a shared secret
  name present in both a local org and user secret-store fixture (the
  file's existing shared `orgSecrets`/`userSecrets` consts use disjoint
  key names, so a local fixture was used instead to avoid mutating
  shared test state) and asserted `resolveFQSN` picks the Organization
  location and omits `value`. No production code changed. Validation:
  file 9/9 passing (up from 8/9), repeated 3x consistent; full
  `config-yaml` jest suite (`npm run test`) 15/15 suites, 288/288 tests
  passing (up from 287), zero failures; `npx tsc --noEmit` clean.
  Committed `3e8373149`, pushed to `origin/main`, Ubuntu1 pre-push gate
  passed (245s, log
  `logs/ubuntu-build-workload-20260924T134933Z.json`). This was the
  final remaining `RELIABILITY-003` candidate family; the "Candidate
  deterministic coverage" list above is now empty.
